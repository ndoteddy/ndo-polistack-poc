## Background

Staying up to date with modern technology is challenging. This project serves as a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for an **Event Planner System**, using **ReactJS** for the frontend and **Node.js (Express)** for the backend API.

We aim to implement a **microservices-oriented architecture**, ensuring low coupling between modules. With reusable React components and APIs, integration with mobile apps (native or React Native) is seamless.

**Current Objective:** `Event Planner API v0.0.2`

Join the project and help build a collaborative community ‚Äî sharing is caring!

**Author:** Nando Teddy
