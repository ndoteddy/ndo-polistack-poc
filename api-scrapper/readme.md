## 🚀 Project: Web Scraping with Cheerio, Docker & Kubernetes

Welcome to `api-scrapper`, a simple but meaningful journey into basic web scraping using **Node.js + Cheerio**, containerized with **Docker**, and deployable using **Kubernetes (Minikube)**.

### 📜 Philosophy

> You're not a great engineer unless you're willing to share your knowledge.
> Most of us will be forgotten—so leave something behind, even if it's a simple repo.

This project is:

* A proof that engineers should do more than just talk.
* A learning base for students, enthusiasts, and even industry pros.
* A fun way to YOLO and document your hands-on pain, not just theory.
